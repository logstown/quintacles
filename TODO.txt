Handle Errors (error.tsx)
Loading indicators (loading.tsx)
cache prisma calls
make adjustor for cover image
metadata

Nice to haves:
better surprise me... go back to clickable restriction buttons
add framer motion animations
look into pregenerating dynamic pages?
notifications for when users make the same list
launch list modal from user screen and home page
make cron job to delete orphaned lists


ideas:
allow anyone to edit any list to create their own
