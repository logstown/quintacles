GO live:
Handle Errors (error.tsx)
cache prisma calls
make adjustor for cover image
metadata

Friends test:
Need to fix epsisode list overflow title
Search suggestions
   -layout shift when searching
Need a place to access current user's page
episode search 
  - placeholder image takes up full height (poster)
  - after choosing episode, poster image does not appear in list

Nice to haves:
better surprise me... go back to clickable restriction buttons
add framer motion animations
look into pregenerating dynamic pages?
notifications for when users make the same list
launch list modal from user screen and home page
make cron job to delete orphaned lists


ideas:
allow anyone to edit any list to create their own
